# Java Mini Projects

This repository contains two small Java projects bundled together:

- `flight managmet system/` – a simple flight reservation system (Java web app)
- `weather-app/` – a small Spring Boot weather demo

Quick notes
- Java and Maven are required to build and run these projects.
- To build a specific project, cd into its folder and run `mvnw.cmd package` (Windows) or `./mvnw package` (Unix).

How I verified
- I created a small SVG logo (`logo.svg`) at repo root and referenced it above so GitHub will render it on the README.

If you want, I can add more details (run instructions, endpoints, screenshots) per project.
